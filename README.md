# Stacking-Ensemble For Binary Classification
```Ensemble learning``` is a method in machine learning that is carried out by combining several models to improve model performance.    
This time, the ensemble was carried out by ```stacking``` several different models used to make predictions, and these predictions were then used as input for a higher model.This higher-level model then produces a final prediction.   
```Ensemble learning``` can also be done with ```bagging``` and ```boosting```.  
This time, using the base model ```SVM Radial``` with ```GLM``` with [Covid-19 symptoms data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemanthhari/symptoms-and-covid-presence?rvi=1)
