# Stacking-Ensemble For Binary Classification

Description This repository contains the Python and R source codes used to build and evaluate the ensemble model for the classification of COVID-19. ```Ensemble learning``` is a method in machine learning that is carried out by combining several models to improve model performance.      
This time, using dataset [Covid-19 symptoms data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemanthhari/symptoms-and-covid-presence?rvi=1) These codes include:

- Data processing: The phase of cleaning, transforming, and dividing data into training data and test data.
- Model development: Implementing various machine learning models as the basis of ensemble models, such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
- Ensemble learning: Applying ensemble techniques such as stacking and voting to combine several models.
- Performance evaluation: Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to measure model performance.
